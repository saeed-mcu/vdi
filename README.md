# DaaS
**Desktop as a service (DaaS)** is a cloud computing offering in which a third party hosts the back end of a **virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI)** deployment.

With DaaS, desktop operating systems run inside virtual machines on servers in a cloud provider's data center. All the necessary support infrastructure, including storage and network resources, also lives in the cloud. As with on-premises VDI, a DaaS provider streams virtual desktops over a network to a customer's endpoint devices, where end users may access them through client software or a web browser.
